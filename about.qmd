My name is **Musharraf Mir Akhmadova**, and I am a second year PhD student in PPPE program. I am interested in doing research and my research interests are **gender economics**, **child nutrition status** and **global health**.

Besides my academic journey, I am also a new mom to a 9-month baby girl named **Fatima**. Fatima motivates me not to give up at times when I feel tired during my studies.
